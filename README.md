Context:
1. The objective of my study is to gather baseline information about the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). The CPB is a potato defoliating pest that only feeds on Solanaceae crops. So far, the only effective control is chemical application. There have been many documented evidences of resistance in the eastern part of the U.S. since there is no other control option. The purpose of my project focus on testing several insecticides, widely used in the western states to control against this pest to determine the LD50. 

2. The results (data) will indicate if the populations in the Northwest is susceptible to chemical compounds or not. This will give us an idea or baseline information of where the CPB populations in the PNW stands. 

3. In this experiment, data will be collected by noting mortality (Alive or Dead) of the CPB (after treatment is applied) on Excel.  

4. There will be at least four different excel files (four insecticides) and three sheets (populations) within each file.
