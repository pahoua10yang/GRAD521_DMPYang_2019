GRAD521 – Data Management Plan


# Data description
1. The objective of my study is to gather baseline information about the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). The CPB is a potato defoliating pest that only feeds on Solanaceae crops. So far, the only effective control is chemical application. There have been many documented evidences of resistance in the eastern part of the U.S. since there is no other control option. The purpose of my project focus on testing several insecticides, widely used in the western states to control against this pest to determine the LD50 and to identify if insecticides effect natural enemies as well as beneficial insects.
2. The results (data) will indicate if the populations in the Northwest is susceptible to chemical compounds or not. This will give us an idea or baseline information of where the CPB populations in the PNW stands. Second objective’s results will indicate if insecticides will affect the natural enemies’ population. 
3. In this experiment, data will be collected by noting mortality (Alive or Dead) of the CPB (after treatment is applied); treatment dosage will range from 0 PPM (control) to 1000 PPM and data will be input in Excel.  

# Roles and responsibilities
1.	This project is funded by the NIFA fellowship (external grant). Under the grant, the person who is responsible for data management and sharing is the lead PI and my advisor.  My advisor’s roles are to creating data sheet and supervision on how the data should be taken. My roles are data taking, creating statically analyzed, concluding my project and making sure my data is secure. 

2. The roles of data collection, data organization, data description and documentation, quality control, data analysis, instrument or software maintenance, access control, archival and preservation will be done by the grad student - Pahoua and she will be the person that is going to make sure that the data management plan will be implemented. 

3. If the student leaves the project - project will be revoked and funds will be taken away; If advisor or PI's leave - someone need to take over the lead role and take responsibility.

# Data standards and metadata
1. Supervisor: OSU faculty 
2. Title: Understanding the CPB in the Columbia Basin
3. Author: Silvia Rondon and Pahoua Yang
4. Subject: Science
5. Publication date: 2019

In my project, I will be working with tabular data which contains the location of each colonies collected, collection date, bioassay date, and code which determines dead or alive. Pictures of insects will be taken and recorded. Data will be store in a CSV file. 
The second project is collecting insects weekly to determine the number of beneficial in the field as well as the number of pests. Data will be sort from life stages from eggs, larvae to adult. Data will be store via CSV file.  
a.	Data documentation: 

Tabular - Data dictionary
Column Head - Location, Date, Time, Code (0 and 1)
Data will be tabular data – which we will document where the pest was collected (locations) and assess it with different insecticides (treatment) and the level of treatment (doses) and tabulate if they are alive or dead (0 or 1)
Metadata will be capture through Excel and a text file. 
Photograph - of Insects
Under a file name: SummerProject2019 (for that year)
Picture label name will be labeled as insectname$date(MMDDYY)
# Storage and security
1. Data context will be storage in multiple storage site such as box and drop box as well as computer storage. Data will be also sent to supervisor/PI's email. 
2. Dropbox is used for modification and Box is used for storing original.
3. Box is through Oregon State University which is a secure site but only given to current student and limited time for you to grab your context once you are no longer a student. Drop box only allow certain amount stored before they start charging. 
4. Link to box will be given to PIs, so correction can be made. 

# Access and data sharing
1. Data will not be published publicly until project is complete and have publish in at least one journal publication. 
2. Plus, data will be public after two years of journal publication (so paper is well established in the science field). 
3. Data can be access through Scholar Archive (from the University)
4. If researchers want to reuse of data; email PIs listed above for permission. 
5. Graphs, tables and others connecting to the data will not be share publicly due to intellectual property rights by the CC. Individual should draw their own conclusions based on their own graphs and tables. The Creative Commons copyright licenses and tools forge a balance inside the traditional “all rights reserved” setting that copyright law creates.
6. Under the CC policies there are no restriction on derivatives and redistribution of the data. 
7. Policies and guidelines will be available with the data (when data is reuse or redistributed) 


# Archiving and preservation
1. Data will be available in Scholar Archive - when thesis is submitted 
2. Preservations will also be in Scholar Archive or a plan with the PIs. 
3. Data will remain in Scholar Archive until University disregard it. 
4. It will be in Excel (csv) format
