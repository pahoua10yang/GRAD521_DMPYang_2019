# Data description
1. The objective of my study is to gather baseline information about the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). The CPB is a potato defoliating pest that only feeds on Solanaceae crops. So far, the only effective control is chemical application. There have been many documented evidences of resistance in the eastern part of the U.S. since there is no other control option. The purpose of my project focus on testing several insecticides, widely used in the western states to control against this pest to determine the LD50.   
2. The results (data) will indicate if the populations in the Northwest is susceptible to chemical compounds or not. This will give us an idea or baseline information of where the CPB populations in the PNW stands. 
3. In this experiment, data will be collected by noting mortality (Alive or Dead) of the CPB (after treatment is applied) on Excel.  


# Roles and responsibilities
1. Identify the data management roles that must be accomplished by someone in the research project where you participate so that the data will be well managed. You can use the general roles that we worked with during the class, but be specific to your project (roles worked during the class are archiving and preservation; data manager; protection of sensitive and protected data; instrumentation maintenance; data collection/data generation; data organization; metadata generation; quality control; data analysis; DMP implementation; access control; software creation and maintenance). If roles are not self explanatory provide a definition. Is there any formal definition of these roles in your research project? Who is going to take in each of these roles in your project? No need to give me the actual names of people, you can say "PI" or "Grad student 2". You may need to talk to your advisor and discuss the roles and responsibilities of the researchers that participate in the project to complete this part of the assignment. 
~This project is funded by the NIFA fellowship (external grant). Under the grant, the person who is responsible for data management and sharing is the PI and my advisor.  My advisor’s roles are to creating data sheet and supervision on how the data should be taken. My roles are data taking and making sure my data is secure. 
2. Choose a definition of sensitive data, and explain it with your own words. Is any of your research data sensitive? If so, what is your plan to protect your research subjects?
~My definition of sensitive data is data that contain confidential information involving more than one parties and should be kept private. I believe my data is sensitive, cannot be shared with anyone besides the university. My plan on how to protect my research data is to put it in a USB drive and dropbx to share between my advisor and I. 
3. Identify any legal or formal documents that affect how you will have to manage your research data. Who is funding your research? Do the funders have any data management or data sharing requirements? If so, explain what these are. Are there any contracts or disclosure agreements that affect you? 
~My research is funded externally by the USDA NIFA program. The USDA-NIFA have a data management plan for funder. One of the requirements for data sharing is – “Data sharing, protection, and public access Describe your data access and sharing procedures during and after the grant. Name specific repositories and catalogs as appropriate. Include a statement, when applicable, of plans to protect confidentiality, personal privacy, proprietary interests, business confidential information, and intellectual property rights. Outline any restrictions such as copyright, confidentiality, patent, appropriate credit, disclaimers, or conditions for use of the data by other parties.” – No contacts or disclosure agreement that I know of.

Under a file name: SummerProject2019 (for that year)
Picture label name will be labeled as insectname$date(MMDDYY)

# Storage and security
1. Data context will be storage in mutliple storage site such as box and drop box as well as computer storage . Data will be also sent to supervisor/PI's email. 
2. Dropbox is used for modification and Box is used for storing orginal.
3. Box is through Oregon State University which is a secure site but only given to current student and limited time for you to grab your context once you are no longer a student. Drop box only allow certain amount stored before they start charging. 
4. Link to box will be given to PIs, so correction can be made. 

# Access and data sharing
1. Data will not be publish publicly until project is complete and publish in a journal publication. 
2. Data will be public after two years of data. 

# Archiving and preservation
1. Scholar Archive - when thesis is submit
2. Preservtions will also be in Scholar Archive or a plan with the PIs.
