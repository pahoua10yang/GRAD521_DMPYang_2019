# Data description
1. The objective of my study is to gather baseline information about the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). The CPB is a potato defoliating pest that only feeds on Solanaceae crops. So far, the only effective control is chemical application. There have been many documented evidences of resistance in the eastern part of the U.S. since there is no other control option. The purpose of my project focus on testing several insecticides, widely used in the western states to control against this pest to determine the LD50.   
2. The results (data) will indicate if the populations in the Northwest is susceptible to chemical compounds or not. This will give us an idea or baseline information of where the CPB populations in the PNW stands. 
3. In this experiment, data will be collected by noting mortality (Alive or Dead) of the CPB (after treatment is applied) on Excel.  


# Roles and responsibilities
1.	This project is funded by the NIFA fellowship (external grant). Under the grant, the person who is responsible for data management and sharing is the lead PI and my advisor.  My advisor’s roles are to creating data sheet and supervision on how the data should be taken. My roles are data taking, creating statically analyzed, concluding my project and making sure my data is secure. 
a.	Data documentation: 
i.	 Data will be tabular data – which we will document where the pest was collected (locations) and assess it with different insecticides (treatment) and the level of treatment (doses) and tabulate if they are alive or dead (0 or 1)
2. My definition of sensitive data is data that contain confidential information involving more than one parties and should be kept private. As of right now, my data is not sensitive but cannot be shared with anyone besides the university and the federal agency until data is published. Data is protected by uploading it into the University storage (BOX) and an external USB drive. As of now, data is only share between my advisor and me. It will be archive through the University and federal agency. 
3. My research is funded externally by the USDA NIFA program. The USDA-NIFA have a data management plan for funder. One of the requirements for data sharing is – “Data sharing, protection, and public access Describe your data access and sharing procedures during and after the grant. Name specific repositories and catalogs as appropriate. Include a statement, when applicable, of plans to protect confidentiality, personal privacy, proprietary interests, business confidential information, and intellectual property rights. Outline any restrictions such as copyright, confidentiality, patent, appropriate credit, disclaimers, or conditions for use of the data by other parties.” – No contacts or disclosure agreement that I know of. Data management plan is needed for this project.

# Data standards and metadata
1. Supervisor: OSU faculty 
2. Title: Understanding the CPB in the Columbia Basin
3. Author: Silvia Rondon and Pahoua Yang
4. Subject: Science
5. Publication date: 2019

Tabular - Data dictionary
Column Head - Location, Date, Time, Code (0 and 1)

Metadata will be capture through Excel and a text file. 

Photograph - of Insects
Under a file name: SummerProject2019 (for that year)
Picture label name will be labeled as insectname$date(MMDDYY)

# Storage and security
1. Data context will be storage in mutliple storage site such as box and drop box as well as computer storage . Data will be also sent to supervisor/PI's email. 
2. Dropbox is used for modification and Box is used for storing orginal.
3. Box is through Oregon State University which is a secure site but only given to current student and limited time for you to grab your context once you are no longer a student. Drop box only allow certain amount stored before they start charging. 
4. Link to box will be given to PIs, so correction can be made. 

# Access and data sharing
1. Data will not be publish publicly until project is complete and have publish in at least one journal publication. 
2. Plus, data will be public after two years of journal publication (so paper is well estabilished in the science field). 
3. Data can be access thourgh Scholar Archive (from the University)
4. If researchers want to reuse of data; email PIs listed above for permission. 
5. Graphs, tables and others connecting to the data will not be share publicly due to intellectual property rights. Individual should draw their own conclusions based on their own graphs and tables. 
6. No policies on derivatives and redistribution of the data yet. 
7. Policies and guideline will be display whereever data is

# Archiving and preservation
1. Data will be availble in Scholar Archive - when thesis is submitted 
2. Preservtions will also be in Scholar Archive or a plan with the PIs. 
3. Data will remain in Scholar Archive until University disregard it. 
4. It will be in Excel (csv) format
